# Kontext UI - Open Source Fal Kontext Demo

## Overview

Kontext UI is an open source interface for the [Fal Kontext API](https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext/api?platform=python), allowing you to edit images using natural language prompts. The system supports robust job tracking, logging, and automatic resumption of incomplete jobs.

## Features
- Edit images using the Fal Kontext API with a simple UI
- Upload local images or use image URLs (images are sent directly as base64 Data URIs)
- Upload a video and extract the first frame to use as the input image for editing (supports mp4, mov, avi, webm)
- Tracks all in-progress jobs in a local `.active` file
- Resumes and saves results for any jobs left in progress if the app restarts
- Logs all activity (prompt, input URL, output URL) to a rolling `activity.log` (with backup)
- Ensures all output images are saved locally if the 'Save output image' box is checked
- Save output images to the `output/YYYYMMDD/` directory, with filenames based on the image hash from the API response.
- Optionally, save the input image alongside the output image by enabling the 'Save Input Image with output' setting. The input image will be saved in the same directory, with `_input` appended to the filename, and will be converted to match the output filetype (e.g., JPEG or PNG).
- Choose the output aspect ratio with a dropdown (default: Match input image, or select from preset ratios like 16:9, 4:3, etc.)
- Output images are displayed in a grid (gallery) when generating multiple images (batch size > 1)
- The seed input updates to the actual seed used after each run, unless 'Lock Seed' is checked (in which case it stays fixed)
- Video-to-image extraction (extract first frame) is available in the left column for easy access

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
# Replace <your-repo-url> with the actual URL
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd fal-kontext-ui
```

### 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended)
```sh
python -m venv venv
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- **Note:** `opencv-python` is required for video frame extraction and is included in `requirements.txt`.

## Environment Variables

You must set the following environment variable before running the app:
- `FAL_KEY` â€” Your Fal API key (see https://fal.ai/models/fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext/api?platform=python)

Example (Linux/macOS):
```sh
export FAL_KEY="your_fal_api_key"
```
Example (Windows, PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:FAL_KEY="your_fal_api_key"
```

## API Key Setup

On first run, the app will prompt you for your Fal API key and store it in a local hidden file called `.fal_key` in the project root. This file is used for all future runs and is ignored by git (not committed to version control).

- If you want to change the key, simply delete the `.fal_key` file and restart the app.
- If you set the `FAL_KEY` environment variable, it will override the value in `.fal_key`.
- **Do not share your `.fal_key` file.**

You do not need to manually set environment variables unless you want to override the key for a specific session.

## Usage

Run the app with:
```sh
python kontext-ui.py --verbose
```

### Host and Port Options
You can specify the network interface and port for the Gradio UI using `--host` and `--port`:
```sh
python kontext-ui.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7500
```
- `--host` (default: `0.0.0.0`) sets the network interface to listen on (e.g., `127.0.0.1` for localhost only).
- `--port` (default: `7500`) sets the port for the UI.
- The UI will be available at the address shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:7500)
- All in-progress jobs are tracked in `.active` and will be resumed on startup
- All activity is logged to `activity.log` (rolls over to `old_activity.log` at 10MB)
- Output images are saved to the `output/YYYYMMDD/` directory if 'Save output image' is checked
- **To use the video-to-image feature:** Upload a video file, click "Extract First Frame from Video", and the first frame will be set as the input image for editing
- **Output Aspect Ratio:** Use the dropdown in Additional Settings to match the input image's aspect ratio or select a preset (e.g., 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, etc.).
- **Batch Output:** When generating multiple images, all outputs are shown in a grid below the input image.
- **Seed Handling:** The seed input will update to the actual seed used after each run, unless 'Lock Seed' is checked.
- **Video-to-Image:** Upload a video and extract the first frame from the left column, then use it as your input image.
